## Introductions

My experience in data science so far has been challenging but rewarding. This post is to demonstrate what I learned in four weeks. I decided to apply my new skills and interpret data to help make life decisions easier after Lambda School. Completing this program will jumpstart a new career and income. Location and compensation are two major factors to consider when job hunting. First, we will analyze the median entry level salary and tax implications in 10 different areas across the country. Second, we will discover the cost of living to see how wages as adjusted. Third, we will determine which city will allow you to save up for a down payment. Last, we will break down the monthly budget to gain a clearer picture of life after Lambda School.

### Where are the highest entry level salaries?

Glassdoor is a great reference for compensation of a [Junior Data Scientist](https://www.glassdoor.com/Salaries/san-francisco-junior-data-scientist-salary-SRCH_IL.0,13_IM759_KO14,35.htm/) role based on company and geography. It seems that San Francisco is the best choice to brag to your friends about your new $109,420 salary. However, in California this gross income is taxed at 29.98% leaving you with a net income of $76,616. Comparatively, Seattle’s gross income is $96,739 and taxed at 22.6% because there is no state income tax in Washington. This results in a $74,876 net income and is only $1,740 less even though you were earning $12,681 more in San Francisco.

[Nerdwallet](https://www.nerdwallet.com/cost-of-living-calculator/) has a useful tool to calculate cost of living. We want to how much we need to save for a standard 20% downpayment on the median 3 bed 2 bath home. Are wages adjusted enough for the astronomical cost of living of San Francisco?

### Where can I save for a down payment the quickest?

Suppose you wanted to determine which city will allow you to save up the quickest for a down payment on a home. Here you can see that it will only take 5.44 years in Austin, while in San Francisco it will take 16.49 years.These numbers might alarm you but keep in mind that there are other variables to consider over time. Your earning capacity will increase as your career progresses.  You could get married and have dual incomes to contribute. Cost of living will also increase as well. 


## Conclusions

Well, looks like I’m either moving to Austin, Texas or will have to work remotely out of a van down by the river in San Francisco. Here is a budget analysis of what to expect when done with Lambda School. Renting a bedroom in apartment with roommates averages $760 in Austin. Also you can see the ISA payment is included in the expenses based on the gross average income of $81K for a Junior Data Scientist.

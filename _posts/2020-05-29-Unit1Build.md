## Introductions

My experience in data science so far has been challenging but rewarding. This post is to demonstrate what I learned in only four weeks. I have applied my new skills of exploratory data analysis to help make financial decisions easier after Lambda School. Completing this program will jumpstart a new career and income. Learning the following objectives will help your job search: 

- Discover the entry-level pay and tax rates in ten different areas across the country
- Analyze the cost of living to see how wages are adjusted
- Determine which city will allow you to save up for a house down payment the fastest
- Reference the monthly budget to gain a visualization of life after Lambda School

The data indicated that San Francisco is the best choice to brag to your friends about your new [$109,420](https://www.glassdoor.com/Salaries/san-francisco-junior-data-scientist-salary-SRCH_IL.0,13_IM759_KO14,35.htm) salary as a Junior Data Scientist. However, in California this gross income is taxed at [29.98%](https://smartasset.com/taxes/income-taxes#hj1AMoS3uX/) leaving you with a net income of $76,616. Comparatively, Seattleâ€™s gross income is $96,739 and taxed at 22.6%. This results in a $74,876 net income and is only $1,740 less even though you were earning $12,681 more in San Francisco. The difference in net income is because there is no state income tax in Washington. 

### Where is the highest cost of living?

The average 3 bed 2 bath single family home in San Francisco is [$1,263,813](https://www.nerdwallet.com/cost-of-living-calculator/compare/austin-tx-vs-san-francisco-ca). To make a standard 20% down payment, you would need to save $252,763. If you save 20% of your annual net income of $76,616, how many years will you need to save?


### Are wages adjusted for San Francisco's cost of living?

The answer is no, wages are not adjusted nearly enough. It will take you 3x longer to save for a  house in San Francisco (16.49 years) vs. Austin (5.49 years). These numbers may be alarming, but keep in mind there are other variables to consider that could equalize the time saving period. Your earning capacity will increase as you gain career experience. You could also get married and have two incomes to contribute. Trends in cost of living will also fluctuate as well.

The data is clear that the frugal location to start your career is Austin, Texas. This budget analysis is what can be expected after having completed Lambda School. In Austin, the average 2 bed / 2 bath rental apartment is $1,520. This example apartment shared with a roommate has a split of $760. Based on the gross annual income of $81,160, the 17% ISA payment totals $1,150 per month. Saving 20% of annual net income will take you 5.49 years to save a 20% down payment because the average home is $347,906.

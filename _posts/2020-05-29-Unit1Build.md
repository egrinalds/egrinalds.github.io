## Introductions

My experience at Lambda School so far has been challenging but rewarding. I decided to put my new data skills to work and discover data to help achieve financial independence. Completing this program will help start a new career and generate income. There are many important factors to consider when job hunting. First, we will discover the cost of living in ten different areas across the country. Second, we will analyze the median entry level salary and tax implications. Third, we will determine which city will allow you to save up for a down payment and start putting equity into a home. Last, we will break down the monthly budget to gain a clearer picture of your new lifestyle.

### Where is the highest cost of living?

Nerdwallet has a useful tool to calculate cost of living. Are wages adjusted enough for the astronomical cost of living of San Francisco?

Glassdoor is a great reference for compensation of a [Junior Data Scientist](https://www.glassdoor.com/Salaries/san-francisco-junior-data-scientist-salary-SRCH_IL.0,13_IM759_KO14,35.htm/) role based on company and geography. It seems that San Francisco is the best choice to brag to your friends about your new $109,420 salary. However, in California this gross income is taxed at 29.98% leaving you with a net income of $76,616. Comparatively, Seattle’s gross income is $96,739 and taxed at 22.6% because there is no state income tax in Washington. This results in a $74,876 net income and is only $1,740 less even though you were earning $12,681 more in San Francisco. 


### Where can I save for a down payment the quickest?
Suppose you wanted to determine which city will allow you to save up the quickest for a down payment on a home. Here you can see that it will only take 5.44 years in Austin, while in San Francisco it will take 16.49 years. These numbers might alarm you but keep in mind that there are other variables to consider over time. Your earning capacity will increase or you get married and have dual incomes.

## Conclusions

Well, looks like I’m either moving to Austin, Texas or will have to work remotely out of a van down by the river. Here is a budget analysis of what to expect once you start your new career. Renting a bedroom averages $760. Also you can see the ISA payment is included in the expenses based on the gross average income of $81K for a Junior Data Scientist.

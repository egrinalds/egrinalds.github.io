## Introductions

My experience in data science so far has been challenging but rewarding. This post is to demonstrate what I learned in only four weeks. I applied my new skills of exploratory data analysis to help make financial decisions easier after Lambda School. Completing this program will jumpstart a new career and income. Location and compensation are two major factors to consider when job hunting. First, we will analyze the average entry-level salary and tax implications in 10 different areas across the country. Second, we will discover the cost of living to see how wages as adjusted. Third, we will determine which city will allow you to save up for a house down payment the fastest. Last, we will break down the monthly budget to gain a clearer picture of life after Lambda School.

### Where are the highest starting salaries?

Glassdoor is a great reference for compensation of a [Junior Data Scientist](https://www.glassdoor.com/Salaries/san-francisco-junior-data-scientist-salary-SRCH_IL.0,13_IM759_KO14,35.htm/) role based on company and geography. It seems that San Francisco is the best choice to brag to your friends about your new $109,420 salary. However, in California this gross income is taxed at 29.98% leaving you with a net income of $76,616. Comparatively, Seattle’s gross income is $96,739 and taxed at 22.6%. This is because there is no state income tax in Washington. This results in a $74,876 net income and is only $1,740 less even though you were earning $12,681 more in San Francisco.

[Nerdwallet](https://www.nerdwallet.com/cost-of-living-calculator/) has a useful tool to calculate cost of living. The average 3 bed 2 bath single family home in San Francisco is $1,263,813. You will need to save $252,763 for a standard 20% down payment. If you save 20% of your annual net income of $76,616, how many years will you have to save?

### Are wages adjusted for San Francisco's cost of living?

Here you can see that it will take 16.49 years to save in San Francisco while in Austin, Texas it will only take 5.49 years. These numbers might alarm you but keep in mind that there are other variables to consider over time. Your earning capacity will increase as your gain career experience. You could get married and have two incomes to contribute. Trends in cost of living will also fluctate as well. 

## Conclusions

Well, looks like I’m either moving to Austin, Texas or will have to work remotely out of a van down by the river in San Francisco. Here is a budget analysis of what to expect when done with Lambda School. The average 2 bed 2 bath rental apartment in Austin is $1,520. With a roommate you can pay $760. Based off the gross average income of $81,160 of a Junior Data Scientist your ISA monthly payment will be $1,150.

title: Does it pay to be tall in the NBA?
subtitle: Discover the top paid basketball players 

---
Basketball was my favorite sport to play growing up. I looked up to NBA players not only for their amazing height, but also for their talent and success. The hard work and daily practices pay off because their annual salaries are some of highest among all sports. This made me wonder, what player attributes were the most important when considering playing basketball at the professional level?

I decided to put my data skills to work and found all the data I needed on [ESPN](http://www.espn.com/nba/salaries). There were no available datasets for all the features I was after. Also, I didn't have any data leakage because I compiled and converted it to a .csv file. After cleaning it up a bit, I was able to find out which players are getting paid the most.

The column headers (features) allow me to predict the salary (target). This was a supervised learning regression problem because the target was a continuous numeric value.

To start, I established a baseline for each position.

Next, I used a Sk-learn linear regression model with default hyperparameters to calculate the Mean Absolute Error (MAE). This was a great starting point but I knew a few techniques could decrease the margin.

Then, I used Ridge Regression with cross-validation and standard scaler.

My final method was Random Forest Regression.

If I tried to predict the salary of a NBA player, $3,476,722 is the lowest expected Mean Absolute Error.

Last, I calculated the Permutation Importances to determine which features affected the target the most.

My calculations reject the null hypothesis that how tall a NBA player is affects their compensation the most. While it is still important, the performance of scoring average is the top Permutation Importance.

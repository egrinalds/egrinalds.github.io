### Introduction

Basketball was my favorite sport to play growing up. I looked up to NBA players not only for their height, but for their talent and success. The hard work and daily practice pays off because their annual salaries are some of highest among all sports. This made me wonder, what stats are most important to play basketball at the professional level?

I decided to put my data skills to work and explore the league. I found data on player salaries and scoring on [ESPN](http://www.espn.com/nba/salaries). There were no available datasets for all the features I was after. Therefore, I compiled the data and converted it into a .csv file. After cleaning it up a bit, I was able to find out which players are getting paid the most.

These values allow me to predict the playerâ€™s compensation based the features. I knew that this was a supervised learning regression problem because the target was a continuous numeric value.

First, I established a baseline by calculating the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of the top 100 NBA players. By accomplishing this, I could then use a linear model to predict the salary based on the features.

Then, the Sk-learn linear regression model with default hyperparameters was used. This was a great starting point but I knew a few techniques could decrease the margin.

Next, I used Ridge Regression with cross-validation and standard scaler. I still think I could do better.

My final method was Random Forest Regression. This was able to lower my MAE score to $3,754,329. 


So if I was able to predict the salary of a NBA player I would expect this much error.

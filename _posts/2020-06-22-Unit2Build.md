### Introduction

Basketball was my favorite sport to play growing up. I looked up to NBA players not only for their height, but for their talent and success. The hard work and daily practice pays off because their annual salaries are some of highest among all sports. This made me wonder, what stats are most important to play basketball at the professional level?

I decided to put my data skills to work and found data on [ESPN](http://www.espn.com/nba/salaries). There were no available datasets for all the features I was after. I didn't have any data leakage because I compiled and converted it to a .csv file. After cleaning it up a bit, I was able to find out which players are getting paid the most.

This was a supervised learning regression problem because the target was a continuous numeric value. The features allow me to predict the salary (target).

To start, I established a baseline by calculating the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) for the data set.

Next, the Sk-learn linear regression model with default hyperparameters was used. This was a great starting point but I knew a few techniques could decrease the margin.

Then, I used Ridge Regression with cross-validation and standard scaler.

My final method was Random Forest Regression. 


If I tried to predict the salary of a NBA player, the lowest expected Mean Absolute Error would be $3,754,329.

Then, I calculated the Permutation Importances to determine which features affected the target the most.

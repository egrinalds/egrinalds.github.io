### Introduction

Basketball was my favorite sport to play growing up. I looked up to NBA players for their talent and success. Over the years, the hard work and practice pays off because their annual salaries are some of highest among all sports. This made me wonder, what statistics are most important. How much does it pay off to be tall in basketball at the professional level. 

I decided to put my data skills to work and explore the league. I found data on player salaries and scoring on [ESPN](http://www.espn.com/nba/salaries.htm). There were no available datasets for all the features I was after. Therefore, I compiled the data into Google Sheets and converted it into a .csv file. After cleaning it up a bit, I was able to find out which players are getting paid the most. 

I have data showing each player’s name, team, position, experience, scoring average and salary. This allowed me to predict was player’s compensation based off these features. I knew that this was a supervised learning regression problem because the target value is a continuous numeric value.

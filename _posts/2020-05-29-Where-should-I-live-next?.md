title: Where should I live next?
subtitle: Find out the most affordable city

There are many important factors to consider when job hunting. Glassdoor is a great reference for compensation based on company and geography. Today, we will look at the median annual salary for a Junior Data Scientist role in 10 cities across the country. It seems that San Francisco is the best choice to brag to your friends about your new $109K salary. However, in California this gross income is taxed at 30% leaving you with net $76K. Comparatively, Seattle’s gross income is $96K and taxed at only 22%. These results leave you with the same net income even though you were earning $13K more.



Taxes are just one important factor to consider. In this next example, I used a cost of living calculator to determine the median home price and 20% down payment in each city. San Francisco tops the graph yet again which makes you wonder. Are wages adjusted enough for the astronomical cost of living? Suppose you wanted to determine which city will allow you to save up the quickest for a down payment on a home.

 
Here you can see that it will only take 5.44 years in Austin, while in San Francisco it will take 16.49 years. These numbers might alarm you but keep in mind that there are other variables to consider over time. Your earning capacity will increase or you get married and have dual incomes.


Well, looks like I’m either moving to Austin, Texas or will have to work remotely out of a van down by the river. Here is a budget analysis of what to expect once you start your new career. Renting a bedroom averages $760. Also you can see the ISA payment is included in the expenses based on the gross average income of $81K for a Junior Data Scientist.

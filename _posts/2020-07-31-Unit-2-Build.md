### Introduction

You see more electric vehicles on the road everyday. They make you wonder, can I afford one? To answer this question, I analyzed the market of Teslas to discover which had the best value. I sampled three different models with varying options. In 2012, Tesla offered a four door sedan called the Model S. Next, a SUV named the Model X that seats 7 became available in 2016. Most recent in 2018, the compact Model 3 was released to the public.

### Web Scraping
There weren’t any easily accessible datasets for my topic so I had to get creative. To create custom data, I used a Python’s [Beautiful Soup](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ng2o98k983k&t=2467s) web scraping tutorial. Parsing the data from [cars.com](https://www.cars.com/for-sale/searchresults.action/?mdId=21655&mkId=28263&page=1&perPage=100&searchSource=PAGINATION&sort=relevance&stkTypId=28881&zc=99019) was easy because of their user-friendly API.

### Linear Regression
I knew this was a supervised learning regression model because the target (price) was numerical. To get started, I established a baseline by taking the mean of the data. This initial value is a rough estimate of what any given Tesla is worth.

### Machine Learning

With a few key features, I was confident that some machine learning techniques could accurately predict the price. Each method reduced the mean absolute error (MAE) to better predict the price (target).

### Permutation Importancess

I was curious which features influenced the price the most. It turns out that mileage was the most important factor in determining the value of the Tesla.

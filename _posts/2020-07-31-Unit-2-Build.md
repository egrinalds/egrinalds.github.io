### Introduction

You see more electric vehicles on the road everyday. They make you wonder, can I afford one? To answer this question, I analyzed the market of Teslas to discover which had the best value. I sampled three different models with varying options. In 2012, Tesla offered a four door sedan called the Model S. Next, a SUV named the Model X that seats 7 became available in 2016. Most recent in 2018, the compact Model 3 was released to the public.

### Web Scraping
There weren’t any easily accessible datasets for my topic so I had to get creative. To create custom data, I used a Python’s [Beautiful Soup](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ng2o98k983k&t=2467s) web scraping tutorial. Parsing the data from [cars.com](https://www.cars.com/for-sale/searchresults.action/?mdId=21655&mkId=28263&page=1&perPage=100&searchSource=PAGINATION&sort=relevance&stkTypId=28881&zc=99019) was easy because of their user-friendly API. The values came out relatively clean because web scraping script removed symbols and converted strings to integers. Finally, I one-hot encoded the categorical features so I can fit a model.

### Linear Regression
I knew this was a supervised learning regression model because the target (price) was numerical. To get started, I established a baseline by taking the mean of the data. If you saw any Model S driving down the street then this is what you could guess it's worth.

### Machine Learning

With a few key features, I was confident that some machine learning techniques could accurately predict the price. Each method reduced the mean absolute error (MAE) to better predict the price (target). 

1. Linear Regression was deployed to do a 80/20 split into training/validation. The split holds out the data from the testing subset to prevent leakage. It is used to minimize the residual sum of squares between the observed targets in the dataset and the targets predicted by the linear approximation.

2. Ridge Regression found a new line that didn't fit the training data as well. In other words, it introduced a small amount of bias into how the new line fit to the data. But in return for that small amount of bias, we get a significant drop in variance. By starting with a slightly worse fit, it can provide better long-term predictions.

3. XG Boost (eXtreme Gradient Boosting) was used because it is engineered for efficiency of compute time and memory resources. It does this by using a block structure to support the parallelization of tree construction. 

4. Random Forest scored the most accurate because each decision tree trained on a random bootstrap sample of the data. This type of ensembling is called Bagging. Each split considered a random subset of the features.

### Permutation Importances

I was curious which features influenced the price the most. As suspected, the mileage was the most important factor followed by the year.

### Conclusion

If I had a budget of $30,000 for my next car then I would be left to choose between an older Model S or newer Model 3. I would choose the Model 3 because it has ludacris mode and auto pilot capabilites. That way I could take a quick nap on my commute.
